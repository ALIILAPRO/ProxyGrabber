# ProxyGrabber

This is a proxy grabber application that allows you to retrieve proxy information from external sources. The application supports grabbing HTTP, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies.

### Usage

1. Run the application. [Download](https://github.com/ALIILAPRO/ProxyGrabber/releases/download/v2.0/Proxy.Grabber.by.aliilapro.zip)
2. The main interface of the application provides three buttons: "HTTP," "SOCKS4," and "SOCKS5." Each button corresponds to a specific type of proxy.
3. Click on the "HTTP" button to grab HTTP proxies.
4. Click on the "SOCKS4" button to grab SOCKS4 proxies.
5. Click on the "SOCKS5" button to grab SOCKS5 proxies.
6. The retrieved proxy list will be saved in a folder named "Proxy" in the current directory. The file names will be "Http-s.txt" for HTTP proxies, "socks4.txt" for SOCKS4 proxies, and "socks5.txt" for SOCKS5 proxies.
7. If the "Open Folder" checkbox is checked, the application will automatically open the "Proxy" folder after saving the proxy list files.
8. You can also visit the developer's Telegram and GitHub profiles by clicking on the corresponding options in the application's menu.
